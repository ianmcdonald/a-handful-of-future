        <p>“The future of” – there’s something about these three words that we really dislike. Whether it’s “the future of the book”, “the future of typography”, “the future of printed matter” or any other future, there’s something about the phrase that completely puts us off. What bothers us most is the suggestion that the future is an unchangeable entity, something that develops completely independent from ourselves. A pre-determined path, to which we should adapt ourselves, whether we like it or not. We don’t buy into that idea. We simply don’t believe in “the future” as a god-like force of nature, something we should humbly succumb ourselves to.</p>

        <p>“Our future”, well, that sounds much better already. “Our future” is something that is manageable, shapeable, changeable, buildable, doable. “A future” sounds pretty decent as well. A plural “the futures”? Why not? Just as long as we can get rid of the idea of the future as something that governs us, like some kind of pre-modern deity. Let us be reckless about it: we govern the future, not the other way around.</p>

        <p>If a small group of people believe in something, it has a future. In the case of a beautiful book, that group can be very small indeed: what you need is a writer, a publisher, a designer, a printer and a reader. </p> <p>Five persons. That’s a small tea party, a medium-sized family, a quintuplet birth, a rock band, a youth gang, a secret society, a bizarre love triangle, a car full of passengers, some shop assistants in an otherwise empty supermarket, the main cast of Seinfeld plus one, a volleyball team minus one, a quiz panel, a crew of rowers in a boat. It is literally a handful. It is almost nothing. And yet, it is enough to shape a future.</p>

        <p>Sure, we can theorize about the future. We can boldly proclaim that the relationship between printed matter and digital media, as it exists nowadays, is akin to the relationship between painting and photography as it existed a hundred years ago. Photography never replaced painting, but it changed painting in such a way that it gained a dimension of self-consciousness: suddenly, the act of painting became part of its own subject. In the same way, digital media will alter printed matter. Printing will gain a self-referential dimension, which signals not the death of printing, but a new state of maturity. That is what we believe. But it is our own, personal scenario. If you see another future – fine! Form a small group, and shape your own future. Either that, or start a volleyball team.</p>
